# Spotify Search 

An exercise from Spiced Academy in Berlin where we're using a proxy to make API access easier.

# Tech 

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Spotify API, AJAX

# Features 

* Users can search for artists or albums, the same way they can use the native search. The infocards, which are rendered after a search, can be clicked and link to the respective artists / albums on Spotify.

* After twenty results a "more"-button is rendered. On click it renders another twenty results. If less than twenty results are available, the button is hidden afterwards.

* A default image is rendered for artists without profile pictures

# Goals while doing the project

* Learning to use an API to display data (using API for the first time)

* Working with AJAX and JSON and making an "infinite scroll" via the "more"-button
